I am a full-stack web3 developer, working on the following open source projects:

- [Punk Domains](https://punk.domains/): Modular web3 domain protocol that can issue multiple domain extensions (used by PoolTogether DAO, Klima DAO, Smol Brains NFT community, Giveth, etc.)
- [Iggy](https://iggy.social/): Web3 Social framework, "wordpress" for Web3 Social. Easily set up a decentralized chat for your community. Open source and free to use for anyone.
- [NFTdegen.lol](https://nftdegen.lol): NFT launchpad and marketplace on the Degen chain, an L3 chain on top of Base built by the $DEGEN community.
- [Send2.name](https://send2.name/): Send tokens to any web3 domain name, across many different chains. 40+ supported domain extensions.
- [Revenue Distributor](https://distributor.iggy.social/): Easily launch a smart contract that can distribute revenue to addresses that you define. Useful tool for DAOs and communities.
- [Periodic Staking Rewards](https://github.com/tempe-techie/periodic-staking-rewards): An open-source smart contract which you can use to set up staking with rewards, an alternative to the Synthetix StakingRewards.sol smart contract and similar.
- [AlwaysLiquid](https://alwaysliquid.com/): Social NFT launchpad and marketplace where NFTs are always liquid due to an integrated bonding curve pool.
- [DappsList](https://dappslist.net/): Various blockchain ecosystem lists, representing projects that are already deployed and live on their respective chains.
- Bobby Cash (WIPüë∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüöß): Easily send or receive USDC privately, using the zkBob protocol underneath. This project is still under construction.

My main guiding principles are to develop open-source software that anyone is free to fork, to build projects in a way that they are not reliant on me or anyone else and can exist forever, and that bring goodness and freedom to the world.
